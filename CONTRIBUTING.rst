Contributing to coleitra
------------------------

Thanks a lot for considering contributing to the project!

Please make yourself familiar with our `code of conduct <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_ first.

This is still an very early state of the project and there is only one contributor (Florian Pesth <fpesth@gmx.de>) right now.

I'm happy to help answering any questions though and get you started, though! Feel free to write me an email and I am sure we can figure something out.
