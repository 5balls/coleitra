\chapter*{Abstract}
\textbf{coleitra} is a spaced repition vocable and grammar trainer software for the Android mobile device operating system. \textbf{coleitra} is the software name and an acronym for \textit{\textbf{co}ntinuos \textbf{lei}tner \textbf{tra}iner}.

Sebastian Leitner was an austrian journalist who came up with a spaced repition learning algorithm for flashcards. The algorithm of \textbf{coleitra} is inspired by the Leitner system but uses a continuos parameter instead of discrete boxes.
